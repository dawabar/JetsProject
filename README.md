# JetsProject

### Description

This application imports a text file to create an ArrayList of Jet objects at an airfield. Users can display the jets with their characteristics, fly the jets, load the cargo jets, have a dogfight with the fighter jets, and create and remove jets from the airfield.  The application uses a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the user.

Topics covered in Week 3:

- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Superclasses
- Wrapper classes
- Abstract classes
- Interfaces
- Lists
- Sets
- Debugging

### Technologies Used

- Java
- Eclipse
- Git
- GitHub
- Markdown (for README.md)
- Slack
- Zoom
- Browser (Chrome-focused)
- Unix/Linux Terminal


### Lessons Learned

This week was surprisingly productive for me.  I finished both the quiz and weekend homework quickly and effectively.  After studying at least 6 human-based languages and a few computer languages, I've come to expect that I will acquire syntax quickly.  That wasn't the case for the first two weeks, but this week things feel more intuitive; I'm in a flow.

One thing that I find challenging is that I can't find sources of elegant Java code.  Perhaps I don't know where to look, but online examples appear to be clever without being beautiful.  Music has arpeggios or riffs; photography has basic rules of lighting, framing, and composition; poetry and music have alliteration, assonance, and structures like quatrains or iambic pentameter.  But I haven't found the same kind of field-specific wisdom of creation for Java code.  It's all very clever, but not specifically beautiful.

I learned this week that it's better to write lots of little steps in a program along the way than to combine multiple steps into a complex execution.  Code is very linear.  This is far different from the combined-arms maneuver concepts or complex strategy that defined my career for the last 20 years.  Thinking simple makes writing code easier.

Object-oriented concepts were core studies this week.  While I still have a lot to learn, they came easily enough.  They always remind me of Aristotle's philosphy on species and genus, from which most modern taxonomy originates.  All of this makes sense across 2000 years of shaping math and science into the modern programming paradigm.
